PyCk v0.8


This is a project involving some relatively simple scripts for those who want to start a newly-started toolkit with Python, which may have issues that will surely be resolved in future releases.
The purpose of this project is to teach Python applications in the field of hacking.
We will also expand this scripts in our next versions and add a few other scripts...



Enjoy :)
